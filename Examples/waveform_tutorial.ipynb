    "## Extracting Waveforms\n",
    "\n",
    "When a certain waveform quantity (e.g. $h$, $\\Psi_4$, etc.) is computed in the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC), it is decomposed in terms of the spin-weighted spherical harmonics (SWSHs) ${}_{s}Y_{\\ell}^{m}$ with the appropriate spin-weight $s$ for the quantity. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h(r,t,\\theta,\\phi) = \\sum_{\\ell=2} \\sum_{m=-\\ell}^{\\ell} h^{(\\ell,m)}(r,t)\\; {}_{-2}Y_{\\ell}^{m}(\\theta,\\phi) \\hspace{3cm} (1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The mode weights of this decomposition can be extracted from the simulation and can be used with the equation above to get $h(r,t,\\theta,\\phi)$. Since the strain $h$ and the Weyl scalar $\\Psi_4$ fall off predominantly as $r^{-1}$, we multiply the values by the extraction radius before writing to disk, which is why the file names are `rh*.h5` and `rPsi4*.h5`. So in our example, we would write $rh^{(\\ell,m)}(r,t)$ to disk as an HDF5 file for all timesteps $t$ in our simulation and for the specific values of the radius $r$ at which we measured this quantity.\n",

    "We expect that the waveform at asymptotic null infinity has the following fall-off behavior:\n",
    "$$ \\lim_{r\\rightarrow\\infty} h \\sim \\frac{1}{r} \\hspace{3cm} (2)$$\n",
    "However, it is evident that our waveforms extracted at finite radii have higher order terms (e.g. $r^{-2}$, $r^{-3}$, etc.) that should not be present in a waveform observed at null infinity. We therefore apply an extrapolation procedure to our finite radius waveforms in order to have a more reasonable final waveform. We also apply a correction for center-of-mass drift in the simulation. To allow for comparison, we provide the following data for each simulation:\n",

    "* `*_Asymptotic_GeometricUnits_CoM.h5` -- waveforms that have been extrapolated and center-of-mass corrected\n",
    "* `*_Asymptotic_GeometricUnits.h5` -- waveforms that have been extrapolated\n",
    "* `*_FiniteRadii_CodeUnits.h5` -- raw finite radius waveforms\n",
    "\n",
    "In our catalog as of March 6, 2019, **only** the waveforms ending with `*_Asymptotic_GeometricUnits_CoM.h5` should be used for analysis. If more corrections have been added to the waveforms since then, please use the more up-to-date versions and update this tutorial. These waveforms also inlcude a factor of $M$ as specified in the name of the file in order to render the data dimensionless ($G=c=1$):\n",

    "$$ r = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\int_{S^2} |g|\\, d\\Omega}$$\n",

To follow this notebook, click [here](https://zenodo.org/record/1215624/files/SXS:BBH:1355/Lev1/rhOverM_Asymptotic_GeometricUnits_CoM.h5?download=1) to download a short waveform of the gravitational radiation $rh$ from simulation SXS:BBH:1355 in our catalog.
